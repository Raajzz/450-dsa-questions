# METHOD 1 | One way to do it would be to reverse both the 
#          | linked list and then you'll have a chance to
#          | find the intersection point.
#          | O(3*N) which is still O(N)

# METHOD 2 | Naive String matching has bad time complexity

# METHOD 3 | KMP Needs auxillary memory. 

# METHOD 4 | Rabin Karp too

# Better go with Method 1 |
