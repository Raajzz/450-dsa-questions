# METHOD 1 | Get the elements into a single linked list by 
#          | starting from a head and placing the elements
#          | onto it's tail and continue the process for each
#          | node in the main list and sort them using merge 
#          | sort.

# METHOD 2 | Brute forcing something, but will result in
#          | O(N^2) solution much less than the Method#1
#          | where 'N' is the length of the main list.

# METHOD 3 | Use a self sorting data structure like Heap or
#          | binary search trees.
