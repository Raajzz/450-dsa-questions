# METHOD 1 | Use a look up table [dictionary in python]
#          | Add elements and given them an occurance counter
#          | if the shuffled string has the same occurance
#          | count then the string is a proper shuffled string.


# METHOD 2 | Sorting or using a set data structure twice and
#          | just comparing the two works
